This research compares the popularity of music genres over the years between Wikipedia data and the Billboard Top 100 data, to attempt to discern patterns of long-term popularity versus in-the-moment popularity.
Wikipedia was founded in 2001; so what music has humanity deemed important enough to record in its largest encyclopaedia in the 23 years since then? While Wikipediaâ€™s pages on musical artists are more indicative of what music people are making, as well as what generation those artists belong to, the Billboard charts are more representative in terms of the songs that people actually listened to. 

Are there large differences between the genres being produced and the genres being listened to? 
Are there differences in what songs are famous and what has since been written about them on Wikipedia?
